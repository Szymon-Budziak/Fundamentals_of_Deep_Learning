# Fundamentals of Deep Learning
Resources and notebooks from Fundamentals of Deep Learning Nvidia course. Final model has accuracy fo 97% in recognizing fresh and rotten fruits. Feel free to access files and work with the notebooks.</p>
The goals of this course was to:
 - learn the fundamental techniques and tools required to train a deep learning model,
 - gain experience with common deep learning data types and model architectures,
 - enhance datasets through data augmentation to improve model accuracy,
 - leverage transfer learning between models to achieve efficient results with less data and computation.
